Docker Ruby Deploy [![Docker repo](http://img.shields.io/badge/docker-repo-blue.svg)](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gullitmiranda/docker-ruby-deploy/)
================

Dockerized Git deploy through SSH service, built on top of [gullitmiranda/ruby](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gullitmiranda/ruby/) image. It uses git 'post-receive' hook and provides nice colored logs for each pushed commit.

Accepts an `IN`, `BRANCH_*`, `USER` and `PUBLIC_KEY` settings through environment variables, if the git history doesn't matter to you, pass only the `BRANCH_*` and `PUBLIC_KEY` settings, which aren't optional

This Dockerized image doesn't allow plain text logins, can only connect to it through the use of a public RSA key.

NOTE: This repository is based on [pocesar/docker-git-deploy](https://github.com/pocesar/docker-git-deploy)

## Defaults

```
USER = git # The user used in the git push
PUBLIC_KEY = "" # Your mounted public key path inside the container
IN = "" # The folder that holds the git bare repo
BRANCH_* = "" # The folder that receives the git checkout depending on the name of the variable
# use BRANCH_MASTER="/out" for example, or BRANCH_TESTING="/testout"
```

## Setup

```bash
$ docker run -d \
    -p 1234:22 \
    --name deploy \
    -e PUBLIC_KEY="/id_rsa.pub" \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:/id_rsa.pub \
    -e BRANCH_TRUSTY="/out" \
    -e BRANCH_MASTER="/out" \
    -v /var/www:/out \
    -e IN="/in" \
    pocesar/docker-git-deploy

```

NOTE: You can use `-e PUBLIC_KEY="$(echo ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"` as well and drop the `-v` part of the public key

## Deploy

```bash
git remote add upstream ssh://docker@yourhost:1234/in # or /home/git/repo.git by default
git commit -m "Behold!"
git push upstream master
```

## Mods

You can inject your bash scripts into the `post-receive` hook by mounting your script to `-v /var/some/script.sh:/userscript`. It can be anything, like set folder / file permissions, execute `npm install`, `bower install` etc. and any type of language (if you install the needed binaries of course).

You can also use `echo "hello world" >> $MEM_LOG` to output stuff to the docker log from any of your scripts. Be aware that the user script will be called everytime there's a push.

The same goes for the setup script, in `-v /var/some/script.sh:/setup`, it will be called once the container is ran. Useful to install extra software you may need (like `ruby`, `node`, `jekyll`). Please note that those tools are ran inside the container, and you may only output or use the `BRANCH_*` environment variables to execute your commands. Eg.:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# this is /setup

apt-get -y -qq install nodejs
wget http://example.com/something.js > "$BRANCH_MASTER/something.js"
echo "something.js downloaded" >> $MEM_LOG # goes to docker logs
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env nodejs

// this is /userscript

var
    path = require('path'), fs = require('fs');

# process.argv[1] === branch
# process.argv[2] === gitref

if (process.argv[1] === 'master') {
    fs.chmodSync(path.join(process.env.BRANCH_MASTER, 'cache'), '0774');
}
```
